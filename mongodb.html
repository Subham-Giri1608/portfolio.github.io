                I am happy for the opportunity to tell you for the position of Database Administrator at Innovation Advertising. <br>
                I have enjoyed my time working to create and manage database  using MongoDB during my career, 
                and I have met and solved many informational and data-related challenges in the process. 
                I am always interested in acquiring better ways to improve database efficiency 
                and performance, and I look forward to learning more about the goals that Innovation Advertising 
                wants to achieve in the realm of safe and secure data management.<br>
                I have maintained multiple database systems using MongoDB Compass as well as in Visual Studio Code
                software. <br> 
                This data was highly important and contained many personal details.I ensured that all safety protocols 
                were followed and that best practices were implemented at all times. <br>

                Thank you for your consideration of my Services.
