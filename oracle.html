            <h2 class="heading"> Create & Manages the databases using Oracle </h2> 
            <p>
                An Oracle database is a collection of data treated as a unit.
                The purpose of a database is to store and retrieve related information. <br>
                A database server is the key to solving the problems of information management. <br>

                <br><h3><i> Benefits of an Oracle database management platform: <br> </i> </h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Oracle’s data management platform provides enterprises with:<br> </h4>
            </p>
            <p>  
                <h5>Application support <br></h5>
                <li>Consistently great performance</li>
                <li>Comprehensive security</li>
                <li>Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) and cloud-based disaster recovery</li>
                <li>Easier cloud migration</li> <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Automation to save time:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>    
                Oracle technologies have automated every operation, 
                from automatic undo management to memory and IO management, disaster recovery, and compression.<br>
                Oracle gives enterprises the ability to manage database infrastructure without managing it manually,
                resulting in increased operational efficiency and cheaper costs.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <h5>Enhanced security:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                Oracle’s data management platform uses Oracle 
                Autonomous Database to improve security by providing always-on encryption and auditing, 
                preconfigured division of roles, and automated patching.<br>

                A self-securing database is more often updated with the most recent security updates 
                than a manually secured database, and it does it without making any human errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Scaling without assistance:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                Oracle Autonomous Database expands up to three times the existing base number of CPU cores without 
                compromising availability or performance, then scales back down when more resources are no longer required. <br>
                As a result, it is simpler to deal with growing workloads and unanticipated or unpredictable changes, 
                as resources match demands perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Put all data to work:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                The lake house can link data lakes and warehouses. It eliminates data silos that impede access to all data and is a vital data management component for analysis as it enables choice. 
                Oracle’s data management platform frees businesses from making choices based on only a subset of the relevant data by making all data accessible to those who need it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Deploy anywhere:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                Oracle goes above and beyond any other cloud provider by offering the same database capabilities on-premises, cloud, and hybrid cloud settings.
                Organizations can build databases and applications in one location and implement them everywhere required, particularly when data sovereignty or safety is a concern, using the same Autonomous Database and Exadata capabilities in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Easy access to analytics:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                Business analysts may establish a self-service data mart or lab employing Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Data Analytics Cloud. 
                Built-in AutoML allows analysts and citizen data scientists to develop machine learning models and implement them in their data marts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Expedite application development:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                By integrating conventional SQL, CLIs, and APIs, Oracle’s data management platform makes it simpler for application developers to design microservices-based applications with diverse data types.
                Oracle’s data management platform helps IT businesses focus on meeting developer expectations by adopting standardized data integration, data security, and data access standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Open-source resources are available in a variety of formats:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, in a lake house created with Oracle Autonomous Database, analysts and data engineers may search data throughout relational data stores, object storage, and open-source services like Hadoop, Spark, and Elasticsearch.<br>
                It allows data scientists to get the information they want without relying on other sources. In addition, Oracle gives analysts, data scientists, and developers the ability to utilize any software they choose in their database deployments, whether Autonomous Data Warehouse or MySQL HeatWave.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Simpler and cost-effective:<br></h5>
            </p>
            <p>
                With a mix of high time-saving efficiency and automation levels, Oracle’s data management platform helps businesses cut expenses. 
                IT companies, developers, data scientists, and end-users all have simple access to the information they need with Oracle, resulting in increased productivity and new business breakthroughs.

                and I have met and solved many informational and data-related challenges in the process. 
                I am always interested in acquiring better ways to improve database efficiency 
                and performance, and I look forward to learning more about the goals that Innovation Advertising 
                wants to achieve in the realm of safe and secure data management.<br>
                I have maintained multiple database systems using Oracle19C software. <br> 
                This data was highly important and contained many personal details.I ensured that all safety protocols 
                were followed and that best practices were implemented at all times. <br>

                Thank you for your consideration of my Services.
